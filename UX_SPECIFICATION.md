## Design Philosophy

### Restrained Vintage
> "Simple enough to use on a phone at the beach, charming enough to linger over on a Sunday morning."

**Core Principles:**
- **Mobile-first:** Design for phone, adapt to desktop, native apps come later
- **Content is king:** Audubon illustrations carry the vintage soul, UI stays minimal
- **Minimal but warm:** Clean layouts with subtle texture and elegant typography
- **Respectful:** No dark patterns, fast load times, clear information architecture
- **Automated quality:** Claude-generated content from validated templates ensures consistency

**Visual Balance:**
- Modern, clean interface structure (no skeuomorphic gimmicks)
- Vintage soul from illustrations + serif typography
- Barely perceptible paper grain texture (5-10% opacity)
- Thoughtful details, never ornate decoration
- Everything supports the birds, nothing competes

---

## Landing Page (Migration Map)

### Purpose
**Primary Goal:** Immediately show what makes Aviary unique - animated bird migration visualization.

**Core Experience:** User lands on the site and sees the Migration Map in full glory. The wow factor is instant. No boring landing page, no pitch - just beauty and discovery.

**Honest Framing:** The map shows what *typically* happens this month based on seasonal data from eBird, not real-time tracking. Frame as "Migration This Month" or "What's Flying Now" — not "Live." Birders are knowledgeable and will notice the difference. The data is real and current-month-relevant; it's just not real-time. (Future: BirdCast integration for genuinely live nocturnal migration forecasts.)

**Secondary Goals:**
- Provide search for specific birds (below the map)
- Allow personalization ("See birds near you")
- Showcase featured migrations

### Layout Philosophy

**The map IS the landing page.** 

Why hide the best feature behind a traditional landing page? Lead with the unique value immediately. Search and exploration are still accessible - just below the spectacle.

### Detailed Layout (Mobile)

Visual Treatment:
- Map fills entire viewport (100vh minus 40px header)
- Paths animate on load (staggered entrance for drama)
- Time slider integrated into map (bottom overlay)
- Text overlays have semi-transparent backgrounds
- "Scroll to explore" hint pulses gently, fades after 3 seconds
```

**Default Map State:**
- **Location:** Global view (shows all continents)
- **Month:** Current real-world month
- **Paths shown:** 5-8 most spectacular migrations active this month
  - If May: Arctic Tern, Sanderling, Warblers, etc. (northbound)
  - If September: Bar-tailed Godwit, Raptors, etc. (southbound)
  - If January: Very few paths (most birds stationary - shows clustering)
- **Hotspots:** 1-2 most critical for current month (e.g., Delaware Bay in May)

**First Impression Flow:**

**Search Interaction:**
1. User types "sander" 
   → Autocomplete shows "Sanderling", "Sandhill Crane", "Sand Martin"
2. User selects "Sanderling"
   → Navigates directly to species page (no modal preview)
3. Clean, fast, familiar

**"Birds Around You" Interaction:**
1. User clicks button
   → Requests location permission (browser API)
2. If granted:
   → Map above scrolls back into view
   → Animates zoom to user's region
   → Updates paths to show local migrations
   → URL updates to /explore?location=...
3. If denied:
   → Shows manual location entry (geocoded via Nominatim, free)
   → "Enter your city or region"
4. If sparse-data region (rural Africa, central Asia, etc.):
   → Fall back to nearest well-covered area
   → Note: "Showing birds near [nearest covered region]. Data coverage in your area is limited — help us improve it by contributing to eBird."
5. If Southern Hemisphere:
   → Season labels flip: "spring migration" in September, "fall migration" in March
   → Or use month names instead of season names to avoid confusion
   → Austral migration handled correctly (birds fly south to breed, north to winter)

}

.featured-card img {
  width: 100%;
  aspect-ratio: 3/2;
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

**Featured Species Selection:**
- Rotate monthly or seasonally
- Show 3-4 enhanced species with epic migration stories
- Click card → goes to species detail page
- Mobile: Stack vertically
- Desktop: Grid layout (2 columns)

**Seasonal Landing Experience:**
The entire landing page subtly shifts with the seasons:
- **Color accent shift:** Migration map's dominant path colors change by season (spring: warm golds and greens; fall: ambers and rusts; winter: cool blues and grays)
- **Featured content:** "This Month's Migration Highlight" — one specific species, one specific location, one specific thing happening. Hand-curated when possible, not auto-generated.
- **Time slider default:** Always defaults to current real-world month. Never show January in July.
- **Status overlay text:** Changes with season ("Peak spring migration" vs "Breeding season — most birds nesting" vs "Fall migration underway")

### User Flows

**Flow 1: Visual Discovery → Search**
```
Land on site
  ↓
See Migration Map (amazed)
  ↓
Drag time slider (explore)
  ↓
Tap a path (learn about shorebirds)
  ↓
Scroll down
  ↓
Search for specific bird (Sanderling)
  ↓
Species detail page
```

**Flow 2: Direct Search**
```
Land on site
  ↓
Scroll immediately to search
  ↓
Type bird name
  ↓
Species detail page
```

**Flow 3: Local Discovery**
```
Land on site
  ↓
See map, scroll to "Birds Around You"
  ↓
Grant location
  ↓
Map personalizes to their region
  ↓
Explore local migrations
  ↓
Scroll down for full bird list
```

**Flow 4: "What's That Bird?" Quick ID**
```
User sees a bird they don't recognize
  ↓
Taps binoculars icon (header) or "What's That Bird?" link
  ↓
3 quick questions (no typing required):
  1. Size: [Sparrow] [Robin] [Crow] [Goose]  ← tap one
  2. Color: [visual color picker — 8 common colors]
  3. Where: [Water] [Ground] [Tree] [Sky/Flying]
  ↓
Results filtered by location + current month:
  3-8 likely matches shown as cards with illustrations
  ↓
User taps the match → Species page
```

**Why this matters:**
The second most common birding use case (after "tell me about [bird name]") is "I see a bird right now and don't know what it is." This doesn't require any AI or image recognition — just a filtered query against existing species data (size, color, habitat, range, season). Simple, practical, high-value.

**Edge cases:**
- **No matches**: Expand filter radius or suggest broadening criteria. "Try selecting a different size or color."
- **Too many matches**: Show top 8 by regional frequency (most common first). "Showing most likely matches."
- **Sparse data region**: Fall back to family-level suggestions. "We have limited data for your area."

**Flow 5: Family Browsing**
```
User is on American Robin species page
  ↓
Sees family context bar below bird name:
  "Thrushes (Turdidae) · 45 species"
  ↓
Taps "Thrushes" link
  ↓
Family page: /family/thrushes
  Brief editorial intro about the family
  Grid of all thrush species with illustrations
  Filtered by region if location available
```

This creates a natural browsing path that field guide users expect. Prevents dead-end pages where users bounce after viewing one species.

### Desktop Adaptations

└─────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why:** The sticky illustration at 35vh on a large monitor wastes screen space. Side-by-side keeps the bird visible while giving content room to breathe. The illustration is the anchor; the content is the payload.

**Why:** On desktop, the map and educational content can coexist without scrolling. The right panel shows "What's Flying Through" context alongside the map, eliminating the need to scroll to learn about the paths you're seeing.

**Key differences:**
- Map can show more paths (screen is bigger)
- Search bar wider (better for longer names)
- Featured cards in grid instead of stack
- Otherwise same experience (consistency)

### Performance Targets

**Critical for landing page:**
- **First Contentful Paint:** <1.5s (map base visible)
- **Time to Interactive:** <2.5s (slider draggable)
- **Smooth animations:** 60fps (map loads, then animates)
- **Initial bundle:** <150KB (code-split heavy features)

**Loading Strategy:**
1. Show map base immediately (static image or simplified SVG)
2. Load animation library (Framer Motion or CSS)

## Species Detail Page

### Purpose
**Answer:** "Is this the bird I saw?" (ID confirmation)  
**Inform:** Interesting facts, sounds, range, migration  
**Invite:** Discover similar birds or explore local migrations

### Design Philosophy: Illustration Always Visible

**Key principle:** The illustration is not just a hero image - it's the anchor for the entire page. It should remain visible as the user scrolls through content, keeping the bird's visual presence throughout the experience.

**Approach:** Sticky illustration that starts full-screen, then shrinks and stays at top as user scrolls.

### Information Architecture

```
1. Hero Illustration (Full Viewport)
   └─ Bird name + scientific name (overlay)

2. Sticky Illustration Card (Shrinks, stays visible)
   └─ Continues to show bird as user scrolls

3. Content Cards (Float below sticky illustration)
   ├─ Facts (What Makes Them Special)
   ├─ Sounds (Audio carousel)
   ├─ Map (Where & When to Find)
   └─ Discovery (Similar Birds)
```

```

**Example Output (Sanderling):**

```
SUMMARY:
These pale shorebirds chase waves along beaches from fall through 
spring, racing the surf in an endless game of tag. Some individuals 
travel over 10,000 kilometers twice yearly between Arctic tundra and 
tropical shores.

LOOK FOR:
• Running along the surf line like a clockwork wind-up toy
• Pale gray upperparts in winter, rusty-orange in breeding plumage
• Stout black bill and legs, plump body shape
• Often in small flocks, aggressively defending feeding territories

DID YOU KNOW?:
• Breeds farther north than almost any shorebird on Earth
• Migrates up to 10,000km from Arctic to Argentina and back
• Young birds often skip first breeding season, staying on tropical beaches
• Critical stopover at Delaware Bay in May for horseshoe crab eggs

CONSERVATION:
• Declining rapidly - 80% population loss in Americas since 1970s
• Vulnerable to beach development, disturbance, and climate change
• Depends on small number of critical staging areas during migration

**Map Behavior:**

**Data-Driven Granularity:**
```javascript
// Determine slider granularity from available data
const sliderConfig = {
  highFidelity: {
    // eBird has monthly data
    stops: 12,
    labels: ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 
             'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec']
  },
  lowFidelity: {
    // Only seasonal data available
    stops: 4,
    labels: ['Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall']
  },
  resident: {
    // Year-round, no migration
    stops: 1,
    labels: ['Year-round'],
    sliderDisabled: true,
    showLifecycleNotes: true  // "Nests May-July" etc.
  }
};

// Auto-detect which to use
const mapConfig = species.hasMonthlyRangeData() 
  ? sliderConfig.highFidelity
  : species.hasMigration()
    ? sliderConfig.lowFidelity
    : sliderConfig.resident;
```

**For Migrants (Sanderling):**
- Default to current month (based on user's date)
- Slider shows 12 stops (Jan-Dec)
- Map updates smoothly as slider moves
- Breeding range (rust), winter range (blue), migration arrows
- Text updates: "In May, refueling at Delaware Bay..."

**For Residents (California Scrub-Jay):**
- Shows year-round range (forest green)
- Slider has 4 stops (seasons) OR is hidden
- Text notes lifecycle: "Nests March-July, pairs mate for life"
- Less dramatic than migrants, but still informative

**Interaction:**
- Pan/zoom enabled (pinch on mobile)
- User location marker if permission granted
- Tap legend items to toggle layers
- Smooth transitions between months (300ms ease)

**Contextual Text Template:**
```

**Similar Birds Logic:**
```javascript
function getSimilarBirds(currentBird, userLocation, currentMonth) {
  // Priority order for matching:
  // 1. Same habitat + currently present
  // 2. Same family
  // 3. Visually similar
  
  const candidates = allBirds.filter(bird => 
    bird.id !== currentBird.id &&
    bird.habitat === currentBird.habitat &&
    bird.isPresentIn(userLocation, currentMonth)
  );
  
  // If fewer than 2 found, expand to same family
  if (candidates.length < 2) {
    candidates.push(...allBirds.filter(bird =>
      bird.family === currentBird.family &&
      bird.isPresentIn(userLocation, currentMonth) &&
      !candidates.includes(bird)
    ));
  }
  
  // Return top 2
  return candidates.slice(0, 2);
}
```

**Tile Content:**
- Illustration thumbnail
- Common name (1 line, truncate if needed)
- One-line descriptor: habitat + size
  - "Small shorebird"
  - "Large raptor"
  - "Woodland songbird"

**CTA Behavior:**
- Tapping tiles → That bird's species page
- Tapping "See more" → Explore page (pre-filtered to user's location + current month)

#### 6. Conservation Thread (Quiet, Not Alarmist)

Conservation is woven through species pages as an informative presence, not a guilt trip:

- **Conservation section** in facts: Only shown if species is Threatened, Endangered, or Declining. Simple, factual. "Declining — 80% population loss since 1970s. Vulnerable to beach development."
- **Actionable links** for conservation-relevant species: Link to local Audubon chapters, habitat preservation organizations, citizen science projects. "Help: Report sightings on eBird."
- **On species page map** (for declining migrants): Subtle visual indicator on the migration path — not a red warning, just a slightly thinner or more transparent path. If tapped, shows: "This species' migration corridor is under pressure from [specific threat]."
- **Tone:** Informative, respectful, never alarmist. Birders care deeply about conservation — surface it tastefully to build trust and purpose.

---

#### 7. Print-Friendly View

Birders often want to bring information into the field. The vintage aesthetic looks beautiful in print.

**`@media print` stylesheet:**
- Hides nav, footer, interactive elements (map, audio, slider)
- Shows illustration at full resolution, centered
- Lays out facts in clean single-column format
- Includes scientific name, family, conservation status
- Includes QR code linking back to the digital page
- Fits on one page for common species, two pages for enhanced

## Content Generation Strategy

### Overview
Use Claude AI to generate consistent, high-quality content from validated templates. Start manual, validate template, then automate.

### Four-Phase Approach

#### Phase 1: Manual Baseline (20 birds)
**Goal:** Establish voice, quality bar, and content patterns

**Process:**
1. Hand-write content for 20 enhanced species
2. Focus on diverse types:
   - Common backyard (Robin, Cardinal)
   - Charismatic (Eagle, Owl)
   - Migrants (Sanderling, Warbler)
   - Residents (Scrub-Jay, Chickadee)
3. Refine until every piece feels right
4. These become gold standard examples

**Deliverable:** 20 perfect species pages + clear understanding of voice

---

#### Phase 2: Template Validation (100 birds)
**Goal:** Prove Claude can match the manual quality

**Process:**
1. Build Claude prompt template (see Facts Section above)
2. Include 3-5 gold standard examples in prompt
3. Generate content for 100 common birds
4. **Review every single one** - this is critical
5. Track failure modes:
   - Too technical/jargon-heavy?
   - Missing personality?
   - Factual errors?
   - Wrong tone?
6. Refine template based on patterns
7. Regenerate failures with improved template
8. Repeat until 95%+ quality rate

**Deliverable:** Validated template that reliably produces good content

---

#### Phase 3: Automated Scale (10,880 birds)
**Goal:** Generate content for remaining species efficiently

**Process:**
1. Batch process in groups of 500
2. Automated pipeline:
   ```
   Input: eBird data + Wikipedia summary
   ↓
   Claude API with validated template
   ↓
   Generated content (summary + 3 fact categories)
   ↓
   Automated checks (length limits, format validation)
   ↓
   Store in JSON files
   ```
3. Spot-check 1% randomly (~110 birds)
4. If spot-check quality drops below 90%, pause and refine
5. Continue until all birds have content

**Deliverable:** Complete coverage of 11,000+ species

---

#### Phase 4: Continuous Enhancement (Ongoing)
**Goal:** Progressively enhance popular species based on usage

**Process:**
1. Analytics identify most-viewed species
2. Manually enhance 3-5 per week:
   - Unique illustrations (not template)
   - Hand-written prose (not generated)
   - Multiple plumage variations
   - Detailed migration narratives
3. Promote from "basic" to "enhanced" tier
4. No pressure, no deadlines - quality over quantity

**Deliverable:** Growing library of showcase species

---

### Template Iteration Example

**Version 1 (Initial):**
```
Generate 2 sentences about [BIRD] and 3 categories of facts.
```
**Result:** Too generic, lacks personality

**Version 2 (After 10 reviews):**
```
You are a naturalist writer. Generate content about [BIRD] in warm 
but factual tone. Include:
1. Summary (2 sentences)
2. Look For (2-4 bullets)
3. Did You Know (2-4 bullets)
4. Conservation (if threatened)

Use examples: [5 gold standard species]
```
**Result:** Better, but still some jargon

**Version 3 (After 50 reviews):**
```
[Full template from Facts Section above]
+ Explicit constraints on length, tone, vocabulary
+ 5 gold standard examples
+ "Do not use these words: utilize, facilitate, individuals (use birds)..."
+ "Do use: active voice, specific details, evocative language"
```
**Result:** 95%+ match manual quality

---

### Quality Assurance: The Slop Detector

AI-generated nature writing tends toward a specific kind of generic warmth. "These remarkable birds undertake an epic journey" is the AI equivalent of stock photography. Birders will recognize it instantly. The slop detector catches this before it ships.

**Automated Checks (slop-detector.ts):**
```javascript
function validateGeneratedContent(content) {
  const checks = {
    // Format checks
    summaryLength: content.summary.split(' ').length >= 25
                   && content.summary.split(' ').length <= 50,
    hasAllCategories: content.lookFor && content.didYouKnow,
    bulletCount: content.lookFor.length >= 2
                 && content.lookFor.length <= 4,

    // SLOP BAN LIST — AI nature-writing crutches
    // If any of these appear, regenerate with explicit instruction to avoid them.
    noBannedWords: !content.text.match(
      /\b(remarkable|incredible|epic journey|fascinating|thriving|testament to|nature's|feathered friend|avian|winged|majestic|awe-inspiring|breathtaking|stunning display|truly unique|remarkable feat|incredible journey|marvel of nature)\b/i
    ),

    // SPECIFICITY CHECK — every summary must contain at least one
    // specific number AND one named location. "Migrates long distances" fails.
    // "Flies 11,000 km from Alaska to New Zealand" passes.
    hasSpecificNumber: /\d/.test(content.text),
    hasNamedLocation: /[A-Z][a-z]+\s+(Bay|River|Coast|Arctic|Pacific|Atlantic|Gulf|Mountains?|Island|Ocean|Lake|Peninsula|Valley|Desert|Forest|Tundra|Prairie|Strait)/.test(content.text)
      || /\b(Alaska|Florida|Delaware|California|Arctic|Antarctic|Amazon|Sahara|Patagonia|Siberia)\b/.test(content.text),

    // UNIQUENESS CHECK — flag if >30% word overlap with any previously
    // generated summary in the same batch. AI tends to produce
    // structurally identical outputs.
    // (Implemented via embedding similarity in batch pipeline)

    // THE "SO WHAT" TEST (manual flag) — each "Did You Know" bullet
    // should make someone want to tell a friend.
    // "Is a migratory bird" → FAILS
    // "Can sleep with one eye open while flying over the ocean" → PASSES
  };

  return Object.values(checks).every(check => check === true);
}
```

**Anti-Examples in the Prompt:**
Include 3-5 examples of *bad* outputs in the generation prompt (with explanations of why they're bad). Anti-examples are more effective than examples for preventing slop.

```
BAD (too generic): "The American Robin is a remarkable bird that can be
found across North America. These fascinating creatures are truly a
testament to nature's beauty."
WHY BAD: "remarkable," "fascinating," "testament to nature's beauty" are
filler. No specific detail. Could describe any bird.

GOOD (specific, memorable): "American Robins famously signal spring across
the northern US, but many never leave — partial migrants, some Georgia
populations skip the flight entirely. They can eat 14 feet of earthworms
in a single day."
WHY GOOD: Specific fact (14 feet), named location (Georgia), surprising
detail (partial migration), not interchangeable with another species.
```

**Manual Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Facts are accurate (cross-check with eBird/Wikipedia)
- [ ] Tone is warm but not anthropomorphic
- [ ] No jargon or unexplained technical terms
- [ ] Interesting and memorable (not generic) — would you tell a friend?
- [ ] Appropriate length (not too verbose)
- [ ] Contains at least one fact-checkable claim (a birder could verify it)
- [ ] Not interchangeable — could this summary only describe THIS species?

// Lazy load audio, don't fetch until play button clicked
const audioRef = useRef(null);

const handlePlay = async () => {
  if (!audioRef.current) {
    // Fetch from Xeno-canto on first play
    const audioUrl = await fetchXenoCantoRecording(recordingId);
    audioRef.current = new Audio(audioUrl);
  }
  await audioRef.current.play();
};
```

### Map Data Structure
```javascript
// GeoJSON for range polygons
{
  "speciesCode": "sander",
  "ranges": {
    "monthly": [
      {
        "month": 1,  // January
        "breeding": null,
        "winter": { type: "Polygon", coordinates: [...] },
        "yearRound": null
      },
      // ... months 2-12
    ],
    "seasonal": [
      {
        "season": "winter",
        "range": { type: "Polygon", coordinates: [...] }
      },
      // ... spring, summer, fall
    ]
  }
}

## Explore Page (Migration Map)

### Purpose
**Primary Goal:** Visualize bird migration as a living, flowing system.

**Core Question Answered:** "What birds are moving through this part of the world this month?"

**Secondary Goals:**
- Show migration as temporal patterns (not just static ranges)
- Make invisible journeys visible and understandable
- Highlight critical stopover sites and migration spectacles
- Support local discovery ("What's here?") after the wow factor

### Revolutionary Approach

**Traditional tools show:** Where birds are (static heat maps, range polygons)  
**Aviary shows:** Where birds are GOING (animated migration flows, birds in motion)

This is the defining feature that makes Aviary unique.

### Design Philosophy

**AI does the heavy lifting:**
- Auto-groups 350+ migrants into 5-8 visual flows
- Infers realistic paths from breeding/winter ranges + flyways
- Filters to show only ACTIVE migrations (birds moving NOW)
- Generates contextual narratives for each month

**User does minimal work:**
- Looks at the map (immediately beautiful)
- Drags time slider (brings migration to life)
- Optionally taps paths/hotspots to learn more
- Scrolls down for traditional bird list

**No toggles, no choices, one perfect default view.**

### Information Architecture

```
1. Migration Map (Full-Screen Feature)
   ├─ Interactive world map
   ├─ 5-8 animated migration paths (auto-grouped)

### Content Guidelines

**Tone:**
- Personal and warm (first-person is OK)
- Honest about what this is (passion project, not a business)
- Grateful to the birding community
- Humble about limitations (work in progress)
- Enthusiastic but not overly sentimental

**"Why It Exists" - Example Structure:**

```
[Opening - personal hook]
This started when I [your birding moment]. I realized there 
wasn't a website that combined [what you wanted].

[The problem]
Most field guides are books (not searchable). Most birding apps 
are functional but not beautiful. Most websites are either 
comprehensive but ugly, or pretty but incomplete.

[The vision]
I wanted to build something that:
• Is always free and ad-free
• Treats birds (and users) with respect
• Combines beauty with utility
• Makes migration visible and understandable
• Celebrates the joy of discovery

[The approach]
This is a labor of love, built slowly in evenings and weekends. 
It's not trying to be a business or maximize engagement. It's 
just trying to be a beautiful, useful resource for anyone who 
loves birds.

[The community]
If this helps you identify a bird, plan a trip, or just brings 
a moment of beauty to your day, that's success. And if you 
want to support it, share your birding story below.

### Comments System

**Technical Implementation:**

**Option A: Third-party (easiest)**
- Use Disqus, Commento, or utterances (GitHub issues)
- Pro: Easy setup, spam filtering, moderation tools
- Con: Third-party dependency, potential privacy concerns

**Option B: Simple custom (aligned with values)**
- Store comments in database (Supabase/Postgres)
- Simple form: message + optional name
- No authentication required
- Manual moderation (approve before showing)
- Pro: Full control, privacy-friendly, aligned with project ethos
- Con: More work, need spam protection

**Recommendation: Defer or use Utterances (GitHub Issues-backed)**

A custom Supabase comments system contradicts the core architecture of "no backend to maintain" and introduces a Supabase project, database tables, spam moderation burden (real even for small sites), and a new failure mode.

**For initial launch:** Use **utterances** (https://utteranc.es). Free, no backend, spam handled by GitHub authentication, aligned with open-source spirit. Requires commenters to have GitHub accounts, which limits participation — but the About page comments section is a nice-to-have, not a core feature.

**Alternative:** Defer comments entirely. The About page is beautiful without them. Add community features only if/when there's genuine demand.

**If community engagement grows (Phase 4+):** Migrate to a custom system with Supabase at that point, when the moderation burden is justified by actual engagement.

```javascript
// utterances integration (About page only)
// Just a script tag — no backend, no database, no moderation burden
<script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js"
  repo="[your-github-repo]"
  issue-term="about-page"
  theme="github-light"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
  async>
</script>
```
